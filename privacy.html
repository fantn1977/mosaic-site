      <h2>What Mosaic collects</h2>
      <p>Mosaic reads health data from your iPhone's health record — with your explicit permission. This includes data contributed by your connected devices and any health apps you've authorized.</p>
      <p>Mosaic does not collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or account information</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Payment information</li>
        <li>Any data beyond what you explicitly grant access to in the iOS Health permissions dialog</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where your data lives</h2>
      <p>All health data processed by Mosaic stays on your device. Mosaic does not transmit your health data to any server, cloud service, or third party. Your data is processed locally and stored locally using iOS's on-device storage.</p>
      <p>This is a deliberate architectural decision, not a default setting. Your health data is sensitive. It belongs to you.</p>

      <h2>What Mosaic does with your data</h2>
      <p>Mosaic reads your health data to compute your Mosaic Score, establish your personal baseline, identify ranked drivers, and calculate training load metrics. All of this computation happens on your device.</p>
      <p>Mosaic does not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share your health data with advertisers</li>
        <li>Sell your data to any third party</li>
        <li>Use your data to train AI or machine learning models</li>
        <li>Aggregate your data with other users' data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Apple HealthKit</h2>
      <p>Mosaic accesses health data through Apple HealthKit. You control exactly which data types Mosaic can read through the standard iOS Health permissions dialog. You can revoke access at any time in Settings → Privacy & Security → Health.</p>
      <p>Mosaic complies with Apple's HealthKit guidelines and does not use HealthKit data for advertising, data brokers, or any purpose unrelated to providing health and fitness features directly to you.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>Mosaic offers a Pro subscription managed through the App Store. Apple handles all payment processing. Mosaic does not receive or store your payment information.</p>

      <h2>Early access waitlist</h2>
      <p>If you join the early access list on this website, we collect only your email address. We use it to notify you when Mosaic launches. We do not share your email with third parties or use it for any other purpose. You can request removal at any time by emailing us.</p>

      <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>Mosaic is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any data from children under 13.</p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we'll update this page and, where appropriate, notify users through the app. The date at the top of this page reflects when it was last updated.</p>
