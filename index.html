      <span class="label">Why Mosaic Exists</span>
      <h2>I built this because I needed it.</h2>
      <p>I spent a year training seriously. Consistent workouts, better sleep, watching the numbers move in the right direction. It worked. I got into the best shape of my life.</p>
      <p>Then I needed surgery.</p>
      <p>The recovery reset everything. When I was ready to start moving again, I had all the same devices, all the same apps — and none of them could answer the questions that actually mattered.</p>
      <div class="questions">
        <p>What was my peak fitness level when I was training regularly?</p>
        <p>Where am I right now?</p>
        <p>How will I know when I've actually gotten back to where I was?</p>
      </div>
      <p>Every app told me today's numbers. None of them had a memory. None of them knew where I'd come from or how far I had to go.</p>
      <p>So I built Mosaic.</p>

      <span class="label">The Gap</span>
      <h2>Your apps track today.<br>They don't remember your best.</h2>
      <p>Health tracking has gotten remarkably good at measuring the present. Your heart rate. Your sleep. Your recovery score this morning.</p>
      <p>What it hasn't solved is context. Without knowing your personal peak — the best sustained performance your body has actually demonstrated — every number is just a number. You don't know if 72 is good or bad. You don't know if you're improving or declining. You don't know how close you are to where you used to be.</p>
      <p>Most apps skip this problem entirely. Mosaic was built around it.</p>

          <h3>What was my peak?</h3>
          <p>Mosaic establishes your personal baseline — the best your data has actually observed, across all sources, over time. Not a population average. Not an estimate. Your real ceiling, built from your real history.</p>
          <p>This is the reference point everything else is measured against.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="answer-card">
        <div class="answer-num">02</div>
        <div class="answer-body">
          <h3>Where am I now?</h3>
          <p>Your Mosaic Score is a single number — 0 to 100 — showing how close you are to that baseline today. Built from multiple signals across your health data: training load, recovery, sleep, resting heart rate.</p>
          <p>And unlike most scores, it shows you the ranked drivers behind it. Not just what the number is — why it is.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="answer-card">
        <div class="answer-num">03</div>
        <div class="answer-body">
          <h3>How do I know when I'm back?</h3>
          <p>When your Mosaic Score consistently trends toward your baseline, you're getting back. When it holds there, you're there.</p>
          <p>No guessing. No comparing yourself to strangers. Just you, measured against the best version of yourself the data has seen.</p>
