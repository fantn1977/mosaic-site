## HERO
*Voice: Second person — reader first*

**Headline:**
You were at your best once.
Mosaic helps you find your way back.

**Subhead:**
Three questions. No app could answer them.
What was my peak? Where am I now? How do I know when I'm back?

**CTA:** Get Early Access

## THE STORY
*Voice: First person — Nick speaking directly. This is the only first-person section.*

**Headline:**
Why I built this.

**Body:**
I spent a year training seriously. Consistent workouts, better sleep, watching the numbers move in the right direction. It worked. I got into the best shape of my life.

Then I needed surgery.

The recovery reset everything. When I was ready to start moving again, I had all the same devices, all the same apps — and none of them could answer the questions that actually mattered to me.

What was my peak fitness level when I was training regularly?
Where am I right now?
How will I know when I've actually gotten back to where I was?

Every app told me today's numbers. None of them had a memory. None of them knew where I'd come from or how far I had to go.

So I built Mosaic.

## THE PROBLEM
*Voice: Second person — back to the reader*

**Headline:**
Your apps track today. They don't remember your best.

**Body:**
Health tracking has gotten remarkably good at measuring the present. Your heart rate. Your sleep. Your recovery score this morning.

What it hasn't solved is context.

Without knowing your personal peak — the best sustained performance your body has actually demonstrated — every number is just a number. You don't know if 72 is good or bad. You don't know if you're improving or declining. You don't know how close you are to where you used to be.

Most apps skip this problem entirely.
Mosaic was built around it.

## THE ANSWER
*Voice: Second person — the product serving the reader*

**Headline:**
Three questions. Finally answered.

---

**01 — What was my peak?**

Mosaic establishes your personal baseline — the best your data has actually observed, across all sources, over time. Not a population average. Not an estimate. Your real ceiling, built from your real history.

This is the reference point everything else is measured against.

---

**02 — Where am I now?**

Your Mosaic Score is a single number — 0 to 100 — showing how close you are to that baseline today. Built from multiple signals: training load, recovery, sleep, resting heart rate.

And unlike most scores, it shows you the ranked drivers behind it. Not just what the number is — why it is.

---

**03 — How do I know when I'm back?**

When your Mosaic Score consistently trends toward your baseline, you're getting back. When it holds there, you're there.

No guessing. No comparing yourself to strangers.
Just you, measured against the best version of yourself the data has seen.

## HOW IT WORKS
*Voice: Second person — instructional, about the user's experience*

**Headline:**
Simple to start. Built to last.

**Step 1 — Connect**
Mosaic reads from your iPhone's health record. No new hardware. No new accounts. Works with the devices you already own. Grant access and go.

**Step 2 — Calibrate**
Over your first sessions, Mosaic learns your patterns. It identifies your peak windows and builds your personal baseline. This takes time — because your real baseline took time to build.

**Step 3 — Understand**
Every day: your Mosaic Score, your ranked drivers, and your trend toward or away from your best. The three questions, answered.

## CLOSING CTA

## DESIGN NOTES

- Hero: dark navy (#0a0e1a), large headline in white, cyan CTA button
- Story section: slightly warmer background tone, humanized — this section should feel personal, not polished
- Three questions in the hero subhead: visually distinct — could be large, centered, sparse
- 01 / 02 / 03 answer sections: feel like chapters, not feature bullets — generous whitespace
- Metric explainer visuals (TRIMP, ACWR) slot into a separate "How Mosaic Thinks" or "The Science" page
- CTA buttons: cyan (#00c6ff) on dark
- Consistent card language with the metric visual concepts
